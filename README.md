# DarkSIde
Mariah Jacobs | Fall 2020

## Overview
Each year, the number of devices and applications we use increases. As we use more technology, the technology also uses us to consume and commodify user data. With DarkSIde, users will learn to identify and resist the design tricks that applications use to distract and deceive. 
DarkSIde uses interactivity to educate mobile app users on the most prevalent design dark patterns we encounter in our digital daily lives. Users can learn, on the go, how to spot dark patterns and then put their knowledge to the test in a competitive quiz. 

Future releases will allow users to track and contribute their own knowledge by submiting their own evidence of dark patterns they find out in the wild.
